A Sized List Datatype
---------------------

Lets cook up our own `List` data type from scratch:

\begin{code}
data List a = Emp
            | (:+:) a (List a)
              deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
\end{code}

We can write a **measure** that logically represents
the *size*, i.e. number of elements of a `List`:

\begin{code}
{-@ measure size      :: List a -> Int
    size (Emp)        = 0
    size ((:+:) x xs) = 1 + size xs
  @-}

{-@ invariant {v:List a | 0 <= size v} @-}

{-@ type ListNE a = {v:List a | size v > 0} @-}
\end{code}

It will be helpful to have a few abbreviations. First,
lists whose size is equal to `N`

\begin{code}
{-@ type ListN a N  = {v:List a | size v = N} @-}
\end{code}
and then, lists whose size equals that of *another* list `Xs`:

\begin{code}
{-@ type ListX a Xs = {v:List a | size v = size Xs} @-}
\end{code}

(a) Computing the Length of a List
----------------------------------

Write down a *refined* type for `length`:

\begin{code}
length            :: List a -> Int
length Emp        = 0
length (x :+: xs) = 1 + length xs
\end{code}

such that the following type checks:

\begin{code}

{-@ prop_size :: TRUE @-}
prop_size  = lAssert (length l3 == 3)

{-@ l3 :: ListN Int 3 @-}
l3     = 3 :+: l2

{-@ l2 :: ListN Int 2 @-}
l2     = 2 :+: l1

{-@ l1 :: ListN Int 1 @-}
l1     = 1 :+: l0

{-@ l0 :: ListN Int 0 @-}
l0     = Emp :: List Int
\end{code}


(b) Constructing Lists
----------------------

Fill in the implementations of the following functions so that
LiquidHaskell verifies respect the given type signatures:

\begin{code}
empty = Emp

add x xs = x :+: xs

singleton x = x :+: empty
\end{code}

(c) Replicating Values
----------------------

Fill in the code, and update the refinement type specification
for `replicate n x` which should return a `List` `n` copies of
the value `x`:

\begin{code}
replicate n x
  | n == 0    = empty
  | otherwise = x :+: replicate (n - 1) x
\end{code}

When you are done, the following assertion should be verified by LH.

\begin{code}
{-@ prop_replicate :: Nat -> a -> TRUE @-}
prop_replicate n x = lAssert (n == length (replicate n x))
\end{code}

(d) Map
-------

Fix the specification for `map` such that the assertion in `prop_map`
is verified by LH. (This will require you to first complete part (a) above.)

\begin{code}
map f Emp        = Emp
map f (x :+: xs) = f x :+: map f xs

{-@ prop_map :: (a -> b) -> List a -> TRUE @-}
prop_map f xs = lAssert (length xs == length (map f xs))
\end{code}

(e) Fold
--------

Fix the specification for `foldr1` so that the call to `die` is
verified by LH:

\begin{code}
foldr1 op (x :+: xs) = foldr op x xs
foldr1 op Emp        = die "Cannot call foldr1 with empty list"

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
foldr _  b Emp        = b
foldr op b (x :+: xs) = x `op` foldr op b xs
\end{code}

(f) ZipWith
-----------

Fix the specification of `zipWith` so that LH verifies:

+ The call to `die` inside `zipWith` and
+ The assert inside `prop_zipwith`.

\begin{code}
zipWith _ Emp Emp               = Emp
zipWith f (x :+: xs) (y :+: ys) = f x y :+: zipWith f xs ys
zipWith f _          _          = die  "Bad call to zipWith"

{-@ prop_zipWith :: Num a => List a -> TRUE @-}
prop_zipWith xs = lAssert (length xs == length x2s)
  where
    x2s         = zipWith (+) xs xs
\end{code}

(g) List Concatenation *(Hard?)*
--------------------------------

Fill in the (refinement type) specification and
implementation for the function `concat` such that
when you are done, the assert inside `prop_concat`
is verified by LH. Feel free to write any other code
or specification (types, measures) that you need.

\begin{code}
{-@ measure sizeXs          :: List (List a) -> Int
    sizeXs (Emp)            = 0
    sizeXs ((:+:) xs xss)   = size xs + sizeXs xss
  @-}
    

concat Emp = Emp
concat (xs :+: Emp) = xs
concat (xs :+: (ys :+: xss)) = concat ((append xs ys) :+: xss)

append :: List a -> List a -> List a
append xs Emp = xs
append Emp ys = ys
append (x :+: xs) ys = x :+: append xs ys

{-@ prop_concat :: TRUE @-}
prop_concat = lAssert (length (concat xss) == 6)
  where
    xss     = l0 :+: l1 :+: l2 :+: l3 :+: Emp

{-@ prop_concat2 :: TRUE @-}
prop_concat2 = lAssert (length (concat yss) == 0)
  where
    yss     = l0 :+: l0 :+: l0 :+: Emp
\end{code}

========================================
Map-Reduce
========================================

<div class="hidden">
\begin{code}

expand   :: (a -> List (k, v)) -> List a -> List (k, v)
group    :: (Ord k) => List (k, v) -> M.Map k (List v)
collapse :: (v -> v -> v) -> M.Map k (List v) -> M.Map k v
\end{code}
</div>

The following is a super simplified implementation of
[Map-Reduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce)
using the [Lists](List.lhs) and `Data.Map`.

\begin{code}
mapReduce :: (Ord k) => (a -> List (k, v))
                     -> (v -> v -> v)
                     -> List a
                     -> M.Map k v

mapReduce fm fr xs = kvm
  where
    kvs   = expand      fm xs     -- step 1
    kvsm  = group       kvs       -- step 2
    kvm   = collapse fr kvsm      -- step 3
\end{code}

**The Problem** If you solved `foldr1` then you should
get a single type error below, in the call to `foldr1`
in `collapse`. Fix the error by **modifying the
refinement type specifications** only (do not modify any code).

**Note:** This problem requires you to have solved the
`foldr1` problem from [List.lhs](List.lhs); otherwise
no points.

Next, we briefly describe and show each step of the
`mapReduce` function.

Step 1: Map Elements into Key-Value Lists
-----------------------------------------

\begin{code}
expand f xs = concat (map f xs)
\end{code}

Step 2: Group By Key
--------------------

\begin{code}
group     = foldr addKV  M.empty

addKV (k,v) m = M.insert k vs' m
  where
    vs'       = add v (M.findWithDefault empty k m)
\end{code}

Step 3: Reduce Each Key to Single Value
---------------------------------------

\begin{code}
collapse f = M.map (foldr1 f)

toList :: M.Map k v -> List (k, v)
toList = M.foldrWithKey (\k v acc -> add (k, v) acc) empty
\end{code}
